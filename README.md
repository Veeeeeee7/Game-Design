# FileShare

### Introduction

An app designed to share files across devices similar to AirDrop. The app will allow files to be shared seemlessly from devices of any operating system.

### Value/Use

First, for people who use Androids, it can be difficult to share files with iPhone or Mac users who use Apple's AirDrop feature. Not only will this app allow for Android users to easily transfer files with Apple users, but it will also allow for people who have devices with different operating systems such as Andriod and Mac or iOS and Windows, it can be difficult to transfer files between them.

### User Interaction and Experience

Users will be able to input a name/ID for their device, which will be shown on the main screen of other users. To transfer files, the user will select the file they want to send and then select the device they want to send it to. The device accepting the file will be prompted to accept or decline the file. If the file is accepted, it will be downloaded to the device. If the file is declined, the file will not be downloaded.

### Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies

To create engagement and encourage users to use the app more, we will implement a score system similar to SnapChat. For every file sent/received, one point will be given to the users score, which will be displayed underneath the users name/ID. If a user has consecutively sent files to another user for three days or more, they will receive a streak, which will also be displayed next to their name. The streak will be broken if the user does not send a file to the other user for one day.

A leaderboard will also be implemented and will display the top 10 users. It will update every 24 hours.

### Scalability and Expansion

After the initial launch of the app, we can work to implement more features such as groups that will allow users to easily share files to multiple other users at the same time. We can also work to implement a history feature that will allow users to see all the files they have sent and received.

### Accessibility and Inclusivity

To be accessible and inclusive, the app will be available on both the App Store and the Google Play Store. The app will also be available in multiple languages.
